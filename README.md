## Abstract
The importance of surveillance is increasing day by day. Maintaining a large number of human resources with CCTV cameras is tedious and quite expensive. An intelligent automatic system to detect human behavior is very essential in public places. For this necessity, we have proposed a framework to predict human activities and categorize them as usual or unusual using real-time footage. Here, the unusual activity includes fighting, vandalism, robbery, etc. The human activity is recognized by extracting the high-level features of the images using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), then passed into LSTM layers creates a score for each input which is used to predict the type of activity.

## Introduction
Recognizing human activity in public places is highly essential as well as challenging to perform. The various environmental factors, whereas many scenarios, consists of insufficient data in the video such as messy backgrounds, unnecessary objects which can lead to diminishing the precision of recognition.
Suspicious activity is an incident or event that seems unusual or out of place. Some of the obvious suspicious activities can be; a person being forced into a car, a person about to attack, etc. By detecting those unusual behaviors, a notification can be alert to the administration which can prevent bad consequences or might be helpful for the investigation.

In recent years, several approaches are used using various datasets to solve the action recognition problem.
### SCANNERA (Product):
SCANNERA is a software solution to detect, extract, classify and describe each and every instance of an interesting object or event appearing in the scene and provides a description of these attributes to other proprietary system layers for further processing such as online monitoring, event sorting, alert management, event visualization, and statistical computations.

### Intelligent, Smart, and Scalable Cyber-Physical Systems (Paper):
They were able to achieve 95% accuracy by extracting the features using the convolution neural network (CNN) on the extracted optical flow slices and pre-training the activities based on the real-time activities. The obtained learned feature creates a score for each input which is used to predict the type of activity and it is classified using a multi-class support vector machine (MSVM).

### Human Action Recognition using 3D CNNs with 3D Motion Cuboids in Surveillance Videos (Paper):
They have conducted their experiments on benchmark KTH and Weizmann dataset using 3D - Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN) with 3D motion cuboid for action detection and recognition in videos. The results exhibit that 3D-CNN outperforms well when compared to state-of-art results.
